  <h2>Understanding modern design systems</h2>

  </p>
  <p>
    A well-structured design system brings consistency and efficiency
    to product development. By establishing shared patterns for
    typography, spacing, colour, and interaction, teams can move faster
    while maintaining a cohesive experience across every touchpoint.
  </p>
  <p>
    Components are the building blocks of any interface. Each one
    serves a specific purpose — whether it is capturing user input,
    presenting information, or guiding navigation. When components
    follow predictable conventions, they become easier to learn, reuse,
    and maintain over time.
  </p>

  <h3>Why standards matter</h3>
  <p>
    Without clear guidelines, small inconsistencies accumulate quickly.
    Buttons vary in size, labels drift out of alignment, and spacing
    between sections becomes unpredictable. These details may seem
    minor on their own, but together they create friction for users and
    slow down the teams building the product.
  </p>
  <p>
    Establishing a shared vocabulary — from naming conventions to
    accessibility requirements — helps bridge the gap between design
    and engineering. It reduces ambiguity during handoff, minimizes
    rework, and ensures that the final implementation matches the
    original intent.

    <h3>Key principles</h3>
    <p>
      Effective design systems are built on a few core ideas:
      modularity, so that components can be combined in flexible ways;
      clarity, so that every element communicates its purpose at a
      glance; and accessibility, so that the experience works for
      everyone regardless of ability or device.
    </p>
    <p>
      When these principles guide every decision — from colour contrast
      ratios to keyboard navigation patterns — the result is an
      interface that feels intuitive, reliable, and easy to extend as
      requirements evolve.
